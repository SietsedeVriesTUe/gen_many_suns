# Genmanysuns
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/670507110.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/670507110)

A program to generate a Radiance sun description consisting of many mini suns.

# How to use
Save all files in ``gen_many_suns/`` to one folder on your system. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder, and execute gen_many_suns.py by providing the name of the original (single) sun description file and the desired dimension (in pixels) of the side of the square on which the suns should be based. A dimension of 32 pixels results in 632 suns, which is deemed adequate for most applications.

Example Command:
python gen_many_suns.py original_sun_description.rad 32
